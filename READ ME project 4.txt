1. commandline starts up Client GUI alone. A method is called in Client's constructir such that mockrepository, motherBuilder and motherTestHarness are started. Also 2 number of child builder and child testHarnesses processes are started up. Then XML build request structure is being sent to repository as List<List<strings>> using WCF postMessage.  Build request XML is generated by the mockRepository and persisted. Buildrequest xml is sent to mother builder by the mockrepo on request from the client. Mother builder inturn sends the xml request string to avalable child builder which builds the dll files, generates testRequest XMl and sends it to the motherTestHarness which then forwards to the available childTestHarness. childTestHarness then requests the appropriate childBuilder for dll files. once it gets them the tests are executed, logs are sent to the folder: \remoteBuilderProtoype\MockRepository\ServiceFileStore
2.GUI can be operated by providing the operatiions in the following manner:
  1. provide number of processes.[ will be disabled now as processes are atuomatically started for demonstration. It becomes availabel again if Quit is clicked.]
  2. ENTER START

  4. enter test name [ every test name for a given author must be different]
  5. double click in the testDriverSubDirectories for fetching files and subdirectories from the mockRepo.
  6. select[only one] any file for testDriver and click testDriver.
  7. similarly repeat for the testedFIles.[ except that multiple files can be chosen]
  8. click add test.
  9. if multiple test structures are to be added to the same Buildrequest then repeat 4 to 8.
  10. clcik Create XML to send the build request generation content to mockRepo, generate XML and perist in mockRepo.
  11. click Build [ to fetch, from mockRepo, list of xml build requests created in the above process ]
  10. click QUITbuilder button for quitting all processes, except GUI. 
  12. can restart all the servers by following step 1 ->
